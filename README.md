## Usage

The following graphical guide has to be done if you want to unlock the game's framerate or play on a higher refresh rate in fullscreen. If you do not wish to use that feature you can scroll down further to the guides on all other features. The graphic setup has to be done only once but as the patcher hot-patches the memory **you have to start the patcher every time you want to use any of its features**.

The game enforces VSYNC and forces 60 Hz in fullscreen even on 144 Hz monitors so we have to override these.

#### TL;DR Nvidia: Use Nvidia Control Panel to set 'Vsync' to 'Off' and 'Preferred Refreshrate' to 'Highest available' on a Sekiro Profile. Troubleshoot: delete the (premade) Sekiro profile, add a new profile by stating the full file path to sekiro.exe and try again. If Preferred Refreshrate is missing or game still locks to 60fps see the guide further down on Nvidia Profile Inspector and general troubleshooting.
#### TL;DR AMD: Use Radeon Settings to set 'Wait for Vertical Refresh' to 'Enhanced Sync' on a Sekiro profile. Start Sekiro in windowed mode and switch to fullscreen once ingame. Troubleshoot: see the guide further down below.

#### 60 Hz monitors: disable VSYNC via driver (use 'Enhanced Sync' on AMD) and use fullscreen, see guide below
#### high refresh rate monitors: use borderless or force monitor to always use highest available refresh rate and then use fullscreen, see guide below

### Follow these steps on Nvidia:
1. Open Nvidia Control Panel
2. Navigate to `Display -> Change resolution`
3. **Make sure your monitor is set to the highest Refresh rate possible:**
4.  [![Make sure your monitor is set to the highest Refresh rate possible](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/331eb420bee67f4e57d7e46601bfd51f462de68f/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f625667767155372e706e67)](#)
5. Navigate to `3D Settings -> Manage 3D settings -> Program Settings`
6. **Check if you already have a Sekiro Profile in dropdown and if so DELETE IT**
7. Manually add Sekiro into a clean new profile: `Add -> Browse ->` Navigate to `sekiro.exe` and select it
8. **Make sure that there is a file path to Sekiro and that it is indeed correct and you haven't loaded a premade (empty) profile**
9. **Set `Preferred refresh rate` to `Highest available`**
10. **Set `Vertical sync` to `Off`**
11. [![Preferred refresh rate Highest available and Vertical sync Off](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/209678e46eb63c150abf394894ef24a75bb664d0/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f56634d754f33362e706e67)](#)
12. Hit apply and close Nvidia Control Panel
13. Start `Sekiro FPS Unlocker and more` and set FPS lock to your desired framerate
14. Start the game and use fullscreen (144 Hz or 60 Hz Monitors) or borderless window mode (144 Hz Monitors)
15. These steps will force disable vsync so it won't limit your fps to monitor refresh rate and also force the monitor to ignore the games request to run at 60 Hz if in fullscreen
#### If you do not have 'Preferred refresh rate' or 'Vertical sync' follow these steps (Nvidia):
1. **Delete the Sekiro Profile in Nvidia Control panel as otherwise it will block all settings from Profile Inspector**
2. Hit apply and close the Nvidia Control panel
3. Download and extract the [Nvidia Inspector](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/nvidia-inspector/)
4. Start the Nvidia Profile Inspector
5. **Check if there already is a profile for Sekiro and if so DELETE IT using the red 'X' button**
6. Press the yellow star icon in the menu bar to create a new Profile (1)
7. [![Vertical sync Off and Preferred refresh rate Highest available](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/531be3614b0742e9065f8c2a19df7e31afcdc7ed/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f6f75664a7239632e706e67)](#)
8. Name it `Sekiro` and select it in dropdown
9.  Press the blue window icon with the plus symbol to add an application to this profile (2)
10. Change file type to `Application Absolute Path`, navigate to your `sekiro.exe` and select it
11. [![Application Absolute Path](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0bb8ace024658dfcb31c5f3347df1505854819ec/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f545669495357562e706e67)](#)
12. Make sure that the file path to the game is correct (3)
13. Under `2 - Sync and Refresh` set `Prefered Refreshrate` to `Highest available` and `Vertical Sync` to `Force off` (4)
14. Hit `Apply changes` and you are good to go (5)
15. The success rate of these steps depend on your GPU and monitor combination, most will work fine however some (mostly older ones) wont, if your monitor is still locked at 60Hz in fullscreen after this then your only option remaining is to play in windowed mode.

### Follow these steps on AMD:
1. Right click on Desktop -> `Display settings`
2. Scroll down and click `Advanced Display Settings -> Display Adapter Properties`
3. **Switch to `Monitor` tab and make sure your monitor is set to the highest Refresh rate possible:**
4.  [![Make sure your monitor is set to the highest Refresh rate possible](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/8ba71a0b512eb68509f7e7506a92a78f3cd47537/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f61774b4862774d2e706e67)](#)
5. Open Radeon Settings
6. Navigate to `Gaming -> Sekiro` or add it manually if it's missing: `Add -> Browse -> Sekiro`
7. **Set `Wait for Vertical Refresh` to `Enhanced Sync`**:
8. [![Wait for Vertical Refresh Enhanced Sync](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/7c00daebb59c7e46c455e30b6caa055c63185dcb/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f456e77595146322e706e67)](#)
9.  Apply and close Radeon Settings
10. Start `Sekiro FPS Unlocker and more` and set FPS lock to your desired frame rate
11. **Launch the game in windowed mode, then switch to fullscreen once in game**
12. The last step is important as AMD somehow does not correctly disable VSYNC otherwise
#### If you do not have 'Enhanced Sync' follow these steps (AMD):
1. Try setting `Wait for Vertical Refresh` to `Always off` instead:
2.  [![Wait for Vertical Refresh Off](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c06be2d7a7be65e379996eee66685209b276dcea/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f417a7a716545332e706e67)](#)
3.  Be aware however that it seems like AMDs latest drivers are buggy in that regard

### To play the game with GSYNC do these additional steps (Nvidia):
1. Under Nvidia Control Panel navigate to `3D Settings -> Manage 3D settings -> Program Settings -> Sekiro`
2. Set `Monitor Technology` to `G-SYNC`
3. You can keep `Vertical sync` on `Use the 3D application setting` now to help remove frame time stutters ([see here](https://www.blurbusters.com/gsync/gsync101-input-lag-tests-and-settings/15/))
1. Make sure that `Preferred refresh rate` is still set to `Highest available`
2. [![Control Panel](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f6c4192ab2f29a0764a3f125dac7f29e4b3377ff/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f636562643154792e706e67)](#)
3. If you do not have `Preferred refresh rate` or `Vertical sync` see the guide above on how to use the Nvidia Profile Inspector
4. Don't forget to Apply and close Nvidia Control Panel
5. Use a 3rd party frame rate limiter like [RTSS](https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/rtss-rivatuner-statistics-server-download.html) and set a frame rate limit just a few fps below your monitor refresh rate, on a 144Hz Monitor use 138
6. Start `Sekiro FPS Unlocker and more` and set FPS lock to your monitors refresh rate
7. Start the game and set it to Fullscreen
8. Enjoy perfectly tearing free variable high refresh rates without VSYNC

### To add a custom resolution:
1. Start the game
2. Start `Sekiro FPS Unlocker and more`, set you desired resolution and enable it by ticking the check box
3. Select your custom resolution in the graphical settings (a default resolution like 1920x1080 or 1280x720 will be replaced with the new one)
4. Be aware that your monitor has to **natively** support this resolution and the ingame HUD will be limited to 16:9

### To use the FOV changer:
1. Start the game
2. Load up your save game
3. Start `Sekiro FPS Unlocker and more`, set you desired FOV value (can be negative) and enable it by ticking the check box

### To use borderless window mode:
1. Start the game
2. Go to `Settings -> Graphical settings -> Monitor Mode` and set it to `Windowed`
3. Set your resolution
4. Start `Sekiro FPS Unlocker and more` 
5. If you want to use a custom resolution make sure you patch and select it now
6. Enable borderless window mode
7. If you want fullscreen borderless enable `Fullscreen stretch`

### To display total death/kill counters in OBS:
1. Start the game
2. Load up your save game
3. Start `Sekiro FPS Unlocker and more` and enable `Log stats` check box
4. In OBS Sources window click `+` and select `Text (GDI+)` from the list, text properties window will pop up
5. In text properties window, enable `Read from file` checkbox and click `Browse`
6. Navigate to the folder where `Sekiro FPS Unlocker and more` executable is located
7. Select either `DeathCounter.txt` (only tracks true deaths, excluding revives) or `TotalKillsCounter.txt`
8. Customize font style, color and position
9.  To add additional counters repeat steps 4-7
10. [![On Stream Display with OBS](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/007910d42ace53ee0db0ea8b61d525751b9d48a6/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4c39546e6f34462e706e67)](#)

### On 'Disable camera auto rotate on movement':
This will completely disable the automatic camera rotation adjustments when you are moving. This is mostly intended for mouse users, enabling it on non-native windows controllers will not work perfectly (some rotation adjustments will be left) and you will temporary lose the ability to slow-tilt (deadzones). Disabling the automatic camera adjustments makes little sense on controllers. If you changed your input device or made a mistake while selecting it simply close the utility, delete the `SekiroFpsUnlockAndMore.xml` file, restart the game and mod.

### On 'Disable camera reset on lock-on':
If you press your target lock-on key and no target is in sight the game will reset and center the camera position and disable your input while it's doing so. Ticking this checkbox will remove this behaviour of the game.

### On 'Automatically loot enemies':
Enabling this will pick up all loot an enemy drops automatically as long as you are in pick-up range.

### On 'Prevent dragonrot increase on death':
This option will remove the effect dragonrot has on NPCs, if an NPC already got dragonrot then it will ensure that their condition won't worsen when you die. The internal dragonrot counter will however keep increasing, nobody will be affected by it though. Keep in mind that there are certain thresholds regarding amount of deaths between dragonrot levels, if you enable this feature and die a level might get skipped so even when you disable it afterwards the dragonrot level for all NPCs will only increase after you have hit the **next** threshold.

### On 'Disable death penalties (except dragonrot)':
Like 'Unseen Aid' you will not lose any Sen or Experience upon death with this option enabled. Dragonrot will not be modified, check the option above to prevent dragonrot from increasing.

### On 'Increase spirit emblem cap. on upgrades':
Whenever you upgrade your prosthetic arm the maximum spirit emblem capacity will now be increased by 1 **permanently**. Deactivating this option will not remove the additional capacity gained by it. With the base 15 capacity and +5 capacity by skills the normal maximal capacity is 20, with this feature enabled you can reach up to 50 max capacity as there are 30 prosthetic upgrades.

### On 'Game speed':
Slow down the game to beat a boss like a game journalist or speed it up and become gud. Game speed acts as a global time scale and is used by the game itself to create a dramatic effect in a few cutscenes. All game physics (even opening the menu) will be affected equally: all time-critical windows like dodge and deflect will be proportionally prolonged or shortened while the amount of damage given and taken as well as all other damage physics will be unaltered. A hit from an enemy on 150% game speed will do the exact same damage as on 80%, the deflect window on 50% is exactly twice as long as on 100% and so on. Of course, Sekiro himself will be affected by the speed too so even though a time window might be different now, the speed which you can react on it is different too. Can be toggled by pressing CTRL+M. Be aware that both speed modifications can potentially crash the game in certain cutscenes and NPC interactions so use them with caution.

### On 'Player speed':
This modifier enables you to control Sekiro's speed independently from general game speed. Combat physics however are not guaranteed to stay the same on every setting. For example if you increase player speed you will be able to react to an attack faster but your own 'deflect' window is shorter now because you move faster. Use this to explore the world or to keep player speed near normal while altering general game speed. Grappling as well as jumping is handled by game speed while falling damage is calculated based on player speed so take care when grappling to a lower level with a low game speed and high player speed as this could instantly kill you as the game thinks you fell to death. Can be toggled by pressing CTRL+M. 
Be aware that both speed modifications can potentially crash the game in certain cutscenes and NPC interactions so use them with caution.

## Troubleshooting:
* Utility can't seem to find the game? - Make sure your game exe is called `sekiro.exe`
* Make sure you followed the appropriate steps and didn't skip any (especially not the deletion of the Sekiro profile!)
* Try disabling `Fullscreen optimization` for Sekiro: right mouse click on `sekiro.exe -> Compatibility-> tick 'Disable fullscreen optimizations'`
* If you are using ReShade make sure your preset doesn't enforce 60 Hz, try removing ReShade and see if it solves the problem
* Try adding the whole game folder and `Sekiro FPS Unlocker and more` to your antivirus's exclusion list
* Try disabling `Steam Broadcast` (streaming via overlay)
* Try to force disable VSYNC even when you are using GSYNC
* Close and disable all screen recording and streaming applications
* Close and disable all overlays
* Close and disable all performance "booster" programs and alike
* Do a clean reinstall of your graphic driver:
  1. Download latest graphics driver for your GPU
  2. Download [DDU](https://www.guru3d.com/files-get/display-driver-uninstaller-download,1.html)
  3. Disconnect internet so windows update won't auto-install minimal driver as soon as you uninstall them
  4. Boot into safe mode
  5. Completely uninstall graphics driver and all of their utilities using DDU
  6. Reboot
  7. Install the latest driver you previously downloaded
  8. Reconnect internet

## Limitations

* the game has forced VSYNC so unlocking the frame rate when your monitor has 60Hz will do nothing. You'll have to disable VSYNC in Nvidia Control Panel or AMD Radeon Settings first, see Usage
* in fullscreen the game forces the monitor to 60 Hz so you'll have to handle this with driver override too, see Usage
* if your monitor does not support Hz override (Preferred Refreshrate missing and Profile Inspector won't work either) you won't be able to play at a higher refresh rate in fullscreen, play in windowed mode as an alternative
* your monitor has to natively support your custom resolution otherwise it won't show up correctly
* if a custom resolution is used it has to be added and selected before enabling borderless window
* due to how the game renders the HUD is limited to 16:9 even on 21:9 resolutions
* disabling automatic camera rotation adjustment on movement is intended for mouse users, using it on a non-native windows controller will disable slow-tilting on sticks until the game is restarted
* Player speed modification needs a loaded save before it can be activated
* Player and game speed modification can potentially crash the game in certain cutscenes and NPC interactions, use with caution
* the hotkey won't work if the game runs in exclusive, true fullscreen mode
